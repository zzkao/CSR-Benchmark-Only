  # ScanRefer: 3D Object Localization in RGB-D Scans using Natural Language
  <p align="center"><img src="demo/ScanRefer.gif" width="600px"/></p>
  ## Introduction
  We introduce the new task of 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language descriptions. As input, we assume a point cloud of a scanned 3D scene along with a free-form description of a specified target object. To address this task, we propose ScanRefer, where the core idea is to learn a fused descriptor from 3D object proposals and encoded sentence embeddings. This learned descriptor then correlates the language expressions with the underlying geometric features of the 3D scan and facilitates the regression of the 3D bounding box of the target object. In order to train and benchmark our method, we introduce a new ScanRefer dataset, containing 51,583 descriptions of 11,046 objects from 800 [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/) scenes. ScanRefer is the first large-scale effort to perform object localization via natural language expression directly in 3D.
  Please also check out the project website [here](https://daveredrum.github.io/ScanRefer/).

  ```
  __Before moving on to the next step, please don't forget to set the project root path to the `CONF.PATH.BASE` in `lib/config.py`.__
  ### Data preparation
  1. Download the ScanRefer dataset and unzip it under `data/`. 
  2. Download the preprocessed [GLoVE embeddings (~990MB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/glove.p) and put them under `data/`.
  3. Download the ScanNetV2 dataset and put (or link) `scans/` under (or to) `data/scannet/scans/` (Please follow the [ScanNet Instructions](data/scannet/README.md) for downloading the ScanNet dataset).
  4. Pre-process ScanNet data. A folder named `scannet_data/` will be generated under `data/scannet/` after running the following command. Roughly 3.8GB free space is needed for this step:
  ```shell
  cd data/scannet/
  python batch_load_scannet_data.py
  ```
  <!-- 5. (Optional) Download the preprocessed [multiview features (~36GB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/enet_feats.hdf5) and put it under `data/scannet/scannet_data/`. -->
  5. (Optional) Pre-process the multiview features from ENet. 
      a. Download [the ENet pretrained weights (1.4MB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/ScanRefer/scannetv2_enet.pth) and put it under `data/`
      b. Download and decompress [the extracted ScanNet frames (~13GB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/3dsis/scannet_train_images.zip).
      c. Change the data paths in `config.py` marked with __TODO__ accordingly.
      d. Extract the ENet features:
      ```shell
      python script/compute_multiview_features.py
      ```
      e. Project ENet features from ScanNet frames to point clouds; you need ~36GB to store the generated HDF5 database:
      ```shell
      python script/project_multiview_features.py --maxpool
      ```
  ## Usage
  ### Training
  To train the ScanRefer model with RGB values:
  ```shell
  python scripts/train.py --use_color
  ```
  For more training options (like using preprocessed multiview features), please run `scripts/train.py -h`.
  ### Evaluation
  To evaluate the trained ScanRefer models, please find the folder under `outputs/` with the current timestamp and run:
  ```shell
  ```
  Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`
  ### Visualization
  To predict the localization results predicted by the trained ScanRefer model in a specific scene, please find the corresponding folder under `outputs/` with the current timestamp and run:
  ```shell
  ```
  Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`. The output `.ply` files will be stored under `outputs/<folder_name>/vis/<scene_id>/`

  ## :star2: Benchmark Challenge :star2:
  We provide the ScanRefer Benchmark Challenge for benchmarking your model automatically on the hidden test set! Learn more at our [benchmark challenge website](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scanrefer_benchmark/).
  After finishing training the model, please download [the benchmark data](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scanrefer_benchmark_data.zip) and put the unzipped `ScanRefer_filtered_test.json` under `data/`. Then, you can run the following script the generate predictions:
  ```shell
  ```
  Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`. The generated predictions are stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/pred.json`.
  For submitting the predictions, please compress the `pred.json` as a .zip or .7z file and follow the [instructions](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scanrefer_benchmark/documentation) to upload your results.
  ## Dataset
  If you would like to access to the ScanRefer dataset, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/aLtzXN12DsYDMSXX6). Once your request is accepted, you will receive an email with the download link.
  --
  2. Download the preprocessed [GLoVE embeddings (~990MB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/glove.p) and put them under `data/`.
  3. Download the ScanNetV2 dataset and put (or link) `scans/` under (or to) `data/scannet/scans/` (Please follow the [ScanNet Instructions](data/scannet/README.md) for downloading the ScanNet dataset).
  4. Pre-process ScanNet data. A folder named `scannet_data/` will be generated under `data/scannet/` after running the following command. Roughly 3.8GB free space is needed for this step:
  ```shell
  cd data/scannet/
  python batch_load_scannet_data.py
  ```
  <!-- 5. (Optional) Download the preprocessed [multiview features (~36GB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/enet_feats.hdf5) and put it under `data/scannet/scannet_data/`. -->
  5. (Optional) Pre-process the multiview features from ENet. 
      a. Download [the ENet pretrained weights (1.4MB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/ScanRefer/scannetv2_enet.pth) and put it under `data/`
      b. Download and decompress [the extracted ScanNet frames (~13GB)](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/3dsis/scannet_train_images.zip).
      c. Change the data paths in `config.py` marked with __TODO__ accordingly.

      ```
  ## Usage
  ### Training
  To train the ScanRefer model with RGB values:
  ```shell
  python scripts/train.py --use_color
  ```
  For more training options (like using preprocessed multiview features), please run `scripts/train.py -h`.
  ### Evaluation
  To evaluate the trained ScanRefer models, please find the folder under `outputs/` with the current timestamp and run:
  ```shell
  ```
  Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`
  ### Visualization
  To predict the localization results predicted by the trained ScanRefer model in a specific scene, please find the corresponding folder under `outputs/` with the current timestamp and run:
  ```shell
  ```
  Note that the flags must match the ones set before training. The training information is stored in `outputs/<folder_name>/info.json`. The output `.ply` files will be stored under `outputs/<folder_name>/vis/<scene_id>/`
