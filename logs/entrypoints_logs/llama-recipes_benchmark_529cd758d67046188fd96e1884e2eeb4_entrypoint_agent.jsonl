  Welcome to the official repository for helping you get started with [inference](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/getting-started/inference/), [fine-tuning](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/getting-started/finetuning) and [end-to-end use-cases](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/end-to-end-use-cases) of building with the Llama Model family.
  This repository covers the most popular community approaches, use-cases and the latest recipes for Llama Text and Vision models.
  ## Latest Llama 4 recipes
  * [Get started](./getting-started/build_with_llama_api.ipynb) with [Llama API](https://bit.ly/llama-api-main)
  * Integrate [Llama API](https://bit.ly/llama-api-main) with [WhatsApp](./end-to-end-use-cases/whatsapp_llama_4_bot/README.md)
  * 5M long context using [Llama 4 Scout](./getting-started/build_with_llama_4.ipynb)
  * Analyze research papers with [Llama 4 Maverick](./end-to-end-use-cases/research_paper_analyzer/README.md)
  * Create a character mind map from a book using [Llama 4 Maverick](./end-to-end-use-cases/book-character-mindmap/README.md)
  ## Repository Structure:
  - [3P Integrations](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/3p-integrations): Getting Started Recipes and End to End Use-Cases from various Llama providers
  - [End to End Use Cases](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/end-to-end-use-cases): As the name suggests, spanning various domains and applications
  - [Getting Started](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/getting-started/): Reference for inferencing, fine-tuning and RAG examples
  - [src](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/src/): Contains the src for the original llama-recipes library along with some FAQs for fine-tuning.
  ## FAQ:
  - **Q:** What happened to llama-recipes?
    **A:** We recently renamed llama-recipes to llama-cookbook.
  - **Q:** I have some questions for Fine-Tuning, is there a section to address these?
    **A:** Check out the Fine-Tuning FAQ [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/main/src/docs/).
  - **Q:** Some links are broken/folders are missing:
    **A:** We recently did a refactor of the repo, [archive-main](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-cookbook/tree/archive-main) is a snapshot branch from before the refactor.
  - **Q:** Where can we find details about the latest models?
    **A:** Official [Llama models website](https://www.llama.com).
