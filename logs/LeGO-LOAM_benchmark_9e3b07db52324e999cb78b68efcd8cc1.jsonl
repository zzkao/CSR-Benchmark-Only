  ## Lidar-inertial Odometry
  An updated lidar-initial odometry package, [LIO-SAM](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM), has been open-sourced and available for testing.
  ## Dependency
  - [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) (tested with indigo, kinetic, and melodic)
  - [gtsam](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/releases) (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library, 4.0.0-alpha2)
    ```
    wget -O ~/Downloads/gtsam.zip https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/archive/4.0.0-alpha2.zip
    cd ~/Downloads/ && unzip gtsam.zip -d ~/Downloads/
    cd ~/Downloads/gtsam-4.0.0-alpha2/
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    sudo make install
    ```
  ## Compile
  You can use the following commands to download and compile the package.
  ```
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM.git
  cd ..
  catkin_make -j1
  ```
  When you compile the code for the first time, you need to add "-j1" behind "catkin_make" for generating some message types. "-j1" is not needed for future compiling.
  ## The system
  LeGO-LOAM is speficifally optimized for a horizontally placed VLP-16 on a ground vehicle. It assumes there is always a ground plane in the scan. The UGV we are using is Clearpath Jackal. It has a built-in IMU.

  The package performs segmentation before feature extraction.

  Lidar odometry performs two-step Levenberg Marquardt optimization to get 6D transformation.

  ## New Lidar
  The key thing to adapt the code to a new sensor is making sure the point cloud can be properly projected to an range image and ground can be correctly detected. For example, VLP-16 has a angular resolution of 0.2&deg; and 2&deg; along two directions. It has 16 beams. The angle of the bottom beam is -15&deg;. Thus, the parameters in "utility.h" are listed as below. When you implement new sensor, make sure that the ground_cloud has enough points for matching. Before you post any issues, please read this.
  ```
  extern const int N_SCAN = 16;
  extern const int Horizon_SCAN = 1800;
  extern const float ang_res_x = 0.2;
  extern const float ang_res_y = 2.0;
  extern const float ang_bottom = 15.0;
  extern const int groundScanInd = 7;
  ```
  Another example for Velodyne HDL-32e range image projection:
  ```
  extern const int N_SCAN = 32;
  extern const int Horizon_SCAN = 1800;
  extern const float ang_res_x = 360.0/Horizon_SCAN;
  extern const float ang_res_y = 41.333/float(N_Scan-1);
  extern const float ang_bottom = 30.666666;
  extern const int groundScanInd = 20;
  ```
  **New**: a new **useCloudRing** flag has been added to help with point cloud projection (i.e., VLP-32C, VLS-128). Velodyne point cloud has "ring" channel that directly gives the point row id in a range image. Other lidars may have a same type of channel, i.e., "r" in Ouster. If you are using a non-Velodyne lidar but it has a similar "ring" channel, you can change the PointXYZIR definition in utility.h and the corresponding code in imageProjection.cpp.
  For **KITTI** users, if you want to use our algorithm with  **HDL-64e**, you need to write your own implementation for such projection. If the point cloud is not projected properly, you will lose many points and performance.
  If you are using your lidar with an IMU, make sure your IMU is aligned properly with the lidar. The algorithm uses IMU data to correct the point cloud distortion that is cause by sensor motion. If the IMU is not aligned properly, the usage of IMU data will deteriorate the result. Ouster lidar IMU is not supported in the package as LeGO-LOAM needs a 9-DOF IMU.
  ## Run the package
  1. Run the launch file:
  ```
  roslaunch lego_loam run.launch
  ```
  Notes: The parameter "/use_sim_time" is set to "true" for simulation, "false" to real robot usage.
  2. Play existing bag files:
  ```
  rosbag play *.bag --clock --topic /velodyne_points /imu/data
  ```
  Notes: Though /imu/data is optinal, it can improve estimation accuracy greatly if provided. Some sample bags can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/jackal_dataset_20170608). 
  ## New data-set
  This dataset, [Stevens data-set](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/Stevens-VLP16-Dataset), is captured using a Velodyne VLP-16, which is mounted on an UGV - Clearpath Jackal, on Stevens Institute of Technology campus. The VLP-16 rotation rate is set to 10Hz. This data-set features over 20K scans and many loop-closures.

  ## Loop Closure
  The loop-closure method implemented in this package is a naive ICP-based method. It often fails when the odometry drift is too large. For more advanced loop-closure methods, there is a package called [SC-LeGO-LOAM](https://github.com/irapkaist/SC-LeGO-LOAM), which features utilizing point cloud descriptor.
  ## Speed Optimization
  An optimized version of LeGO-LOAM can be found [here](https://github.com/facontidavide/LeGO-LOAM/tree/speed_optimization). All credits go to @facontidavide. Improvements in this directory include but not limited to:
      + To improve the quality of the code, making it more readable, consistent and easier to understand and modify.
      + To remove hard-coded values and use proper configuration files to describe the hardware.
      + To improve performance, in terms of amount of CPU used to calculate the same result.
      + To convert a multi-process application into a single-process / multi-threading one; this makes the algorithm more deterministic and slightly faster.
      + To make it easier and faster to work with rosbags: processing a rosbag should be done at maximum speed allowed by the CPU and in a deterministic way.
      + As a consequence of the previous point, creating unit and regression tests will be easier.

  Usage: apt [options] command
  apt is a commandline package manager and provides commands for
  searching and managing as well as querying information about packages.
  It provides the same functionality as the specialized APT tools,
  like apt-get and apt-cache, but enables options more suitable for
  interactive use by default.
